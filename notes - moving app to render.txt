"dev": "npm-run-all -p server client",

development:

BACKEND

starting server - npm run server

server.ts - swap commented out code for helmet (applies also to Heroku version)

FRONTEND

starting frontend: npm run start

tailwind.ts - comment out one line of code in purge (applies also to Heroku version)

code changes compared to Heroku:

- code shared between frontend and backend had to be duplicated (types)
- dependencies shared had to be installed separetely in frontedn and backend
- frontend - type issue (wrong type coercion?) in Bookmarks & Tabs corrected  
- some @ts-ignores had to be added (both frontend and backend?)
- frontend: MainRoute - longer timeout for reexecuting of background img fetching
