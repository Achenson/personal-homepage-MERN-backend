# SmoothTabs - personal homepage [fullstack]

Manage bookmarks, RSS channels and notes in a form of draggable & foldable tabs.

Register to get persistent data storage and an option to upload an image as a background. Unregistered user's data is preserved in local storage.

- Drag the tabs between columns
- Choose between plain color or image background modes
- Set default opened/closed state for each tab, reset to default with one click
- Control individual or global tab colors and RSS settings
- Customize number, color and width of columns

WARNING: uploaded images are visible to the admin, as the app uses an imgBB account for image storage. Images need to be reuploaded after every 6 months.

Refer to app's tips & trick note for advanced usage.
